How can we help?

Adding a file to a repository using the command line
MAC WINDOWS LINUX
You can upload an existing file to a GitHub repository using the command line.

Tip: You can also add an existing file to a repository from the GitHub website.
This procedure assumes you've already:

Created a repository on GitHub, or have an existing repository owned by someone else you'd like to contribute to
Cloned the repository locally on your computer
Warning: Never git add, commit, or push sensitive information to a remote repository. Sensitive information can include, but is not limited to:

Passwords
SSH keys
AWS access keys
API keys
Credit card numbers
PIN numbers
For more information, see "Removing sensitive data from a repository."
On your computer, move the file you'd like to upload to GitHub into the local directory that was created when you cloned the repository.
Open Terminal.

Change the current working directory to your local repository.

Stage the file for commit to your local repository.

git add .
# Adds the file to your local repository and stages it for commit. To unstage a file, use 'git reset HEAD YOUR-FILE'.
Commit the file that you've staged in your local repository.

git commit -m "Add existing file"
# Commits the tracked changes and prepares them to be pushed to a remote repository. To remove this commit and modify the file, use 'git reset --soft HEAD~1' and commit and add the file again.
Push the changes in your local repository to GitHub.

git push origin your-branch
# Pushes the changes in your local repository up to the remote repository you specified as the origin
